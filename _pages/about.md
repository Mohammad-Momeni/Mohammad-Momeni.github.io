I'm **Mohammad Matin Momeni Ravandi**, and I'm currently finishing my **B.Sc.** in **Computer Engineering** at **Shahid Beheshti University**.
I’m deeply fascinated by **robotics** — the mix of hardware and intelligence that brings machines to life.
**Machine learning** excites me because of its ability to uncover patterns and push the boundaries of what’s possible.

When I’m not in front of my code editor, you’ll probably find me lost in a good film or bingeing a great TV series — I love engaging stories that make me think.
And when it comes to gaming, I’m all about the challenge: few things are as rewarding as finally taking down a boss in the "Soulsborne" series after hours of struggle (and maybe a few too many failed attempts).
